# Chromaticity

Chromaticity is a visualization design assistance tool to make picking colors
that are more readily accessible to a diversity of end-users.
Written in Javascript, it uses a simple foundation of vanilla JS, ES6 modules,
and D3. Styling is done in SASS.

If have suggestions or would like to contribute, please get in touch or open an
issue and I'll get in touch as soon as I can!
